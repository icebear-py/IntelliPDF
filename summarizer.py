You are creating a balanced newspaper summary from these chunk summaries.
Identify all the sections from data (e.g., Politics, Business, Sports, World, Tech, Miscellaneous).
Each section should be exactly {target_words} words (Â±20) and contain 8-12 bullet points.

CRITICAL: If one section has too many points, merge similar ones. If another has too few, expand it.
All sections must be equal length. Use these entities if relevant: {mi}
Do not duplicate the same point across multiple sections. Place each unique fact in the single most appropriate section; if needed, cross-reference briefly instead of repeating.

Return Markdown with level-3 headings and bullet points:
### Section Name
- bullet point 1
- bullet point 2
